# Ensemble Learning for COVID-19 Risk Prediction
- implemented 7 prognosis risk prediction models for COVID-19
- introduced a competence quantification framework for assessing the competence/confidence of a model in predicting a given data entry (i.e. a digital representation of a covid patient)
- ensembled 7 prediction models for prediction using fusion strategies based on their competences
- evaluated single models and the ensembled mode on two large COVID-19 cohorts from Wuhan, China (N=2,384) and King's College Hospital (N=1,475)
